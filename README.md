eMI3 Mockup CLI
===============

Thank you for your interest in the Electro Mobility ICT Interoperability
Initiative (eMI3) Open Source Implementation, which is currently being
administered by the Belectric Group (Belectric Drive GmbH / Belectric IT
Solutions GmbH). This software is maintained to support the requirements
analysis in WG55 (Communication Protocols) and to ensure the practicability of
the upcoming standard. Therefore it is _not_ intended for production use, but
for reference and educational purpose only.

We appreciate your participation in this ongoing project, and your help to
improve it. If you find bugs, want to request a feature or send us a pull
request, feel free to use the normal GitHub features to do so. For this please
read the _Contributor License Agreement_ carefully and send us a signed copy.

If you are working in the field of e-mobility you should consider to become a
member of the eMI3 group. For more details on the benefits of a membership
